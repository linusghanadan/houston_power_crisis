### Context

This project was completed for my Geospatial Analysis & Remote Sensing class, taken as part of my Master's program at UC Santa Barbara. Provided with data and questions, I carried out this analysis using appropriate geospatial modeling techniques.

### Question

During the 2021 Houston Power Crisis, in which census tracts did residential blackouts occur, and how did this relate to a census tract's median income?

### Analysis Summary

Used data from NASA's VIIRS instrument to conduct a spatial analysis of the 2021 Houston Power Crisis. Determined and visualized census tracts in the Houston metropolitan area where residential blackouts occurred and analyzed how this related to median income of census tracts.
